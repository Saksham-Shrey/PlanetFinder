# PlanetFinder
This project uses the publicly available data accumulated by the Kepler Telescope to find human habitable planets.


The criteria of filtring the planets is derived from the article titled [A Review of the Best Habitable Planet Candidates](https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2015/01/30/a-review-of-the-best-habitable-planet-candidates/) by Paul Gilster published on January 30, 2015.


## How to setup and use it locally

<em>(Assuming the local machine has a github account connected to it)</em>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Fork this repo and clone it in the local machine</li>
<br>
<li>Open it using some code editor (say VS Code)</li>
<br>
<p><em>(It should now prompt you to install some extensions which are required for running the node.js executable file i.e app.js. Go ahead and install them.)</em></p>
<p><em>(If you don't have node installed locally in your local machine, install it now)</em></p>
<br>
<li> Now, navigate to the cloned repo folder in your machine using the CLI (say Mac's 'Terminal') <em></li>
<p>[Note: The app.js file should be on the same directory level as in the one which you are at (In simple terms, enter 'ls' in the terminal and press enter while being inside the cloned repo folder and if app.js gets listed, you are good to go)]</em></p>
<br>
<li> Type the following command and run it: </li>

```
node app.js
```

</ol>
<br>
<p>Kudos !! It should now display all of the possibly habitable planets from the Kepler Telescope data based on the above mentioned criteria. </p>

### Thanks for using my project. Hope you liked it. ðŸ˜„
